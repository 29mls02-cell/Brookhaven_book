        <h1>Brookhaven: Shadows beneath the town</h1>
        <h2>Part 1: Arrival</h2>
        <h3>Chapter 1: The new house</h3>
        <p>Lila didn’t mind moving to a new town alone. She preferred it. People were unpredictable, and Brookhaven promised isolation, and secrets. She smirked at the thought. Some people spent their lives running from danger; she preferred welcoming it.</p>
        <p>As she walked through the desolate hallways and rooms in the house, she came upon a closet that she tried to open, but failed. She found a room to sleep in. Something about it felt off, but she liked it that way. She adored it.</p>
        <p>When she carried her suitcase upstairs, she noticed the closet handle shimmered faintly. She tried again, and it opened. She finds a locked book and tries to use her lockpicking skills to open it. No matter what angle she tried, the lock would not yield. It was as if the house itself didn’t want her to open it. She reads the title, “The Blackened Quill: Notes on the Art of Unsettling People Politely.” Of course the house had a locked book. What else would a normal house have? Likely nothing worth dying for, but she was curious anyway. </p>
        <p>After accepting that the book will probably never unlock, she looks out her window and sees several neighbors staring up at the same window. They stood still, eye to eye with her through the window. Among them, a shadowed figure rustled, staring straight into her soul.The figure didn’t move, didn’t blink. And then, as if noticing her gaze, it vanished into the crowd.</p>
        <h3>Chapter 2: Strange welcome</h3>
        <P>Brookhaven was nothing like the brochures promised, smaller, quieter, far less impressive. Perfect. Exactly the way she liked it. She walked the empty streets, the early morning breeze cool against her skin, carrying the cries of ravens and crows, her favorites. Her school was about an hour’s walk from her house, so she thought it best to start early. The houses stood in silence, their windows dark and unblinking. A loose shutter banged softly in the wind, echoing down the street. Quiet streets, quiet neighbors, quiet lives. Just the way a good mystery begins.</P>
        <p>Brookhaven High School was far more crowded than the empty streets outside. She paused at the entrance. The throng of students was overwhelming, and for a moment, she wondered if retreating was a better idea. Crowds were chaotic, loud, and terrifying—but she preferred terrifying to boring.</p>
        <p>Ms. Thorne showed her to her seat. As she sat, she noticed a strange symbol on the desk. An upside-down star with a goat’s face at its center, encircled by a thin line. Well, this was subtle, she thought.</p>
        <p>The room smelled faintly of dust and chalk, the sunlight through the windows patchy and uneven. Students murmured quietly to one another, their voices low and rehearsed, as if they had practiced calm. She took a seat near the back, noting the way the desks creaked under too-light movements and how Ms. Thorne’s sharp gaze scanned the room like a measuring stick. Nothing here was immediately threatening, but something in the careful quiet felt…off. Perfect for someone like her.</p>
        <p>“Welcome, class,” Ms. Thorne began. “Welcome to History.”</p>
        <p>“Hello Ms. Thorne. We’re glad to have you this year,” said everyone, monotone, all but Lila.</p>
        <p>“Same to you, class,” she started again. “History is noticing what everyone else ignores.”</p>
